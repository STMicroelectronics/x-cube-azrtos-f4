## <b>Nx_MQTT_Client application description</b>

This application provides an example of Azure RTOS NetX/NetXDuo stack usage . 
It shows how to exchange data between client and server using MQTT protocol in an encrypted mode supporting TLS v1.2.

The main entry function tx_application_define() is called by ThreadX during kernel start, at this stage, all NetX resources are created.

 + A NX_PACKET_POOL is allocated
 
 + A NX_IP instance using that pool is initialized
 
 + The ARP, ICMP and protocols (TCP and UDP) are enabled for the NX_IP instance
 
 + A DHCP client is created.
 
The application then creates 2 threads with different priorities:

 + **AppMainThread** (priority 10, PreemtionThreashold 10) : created with the TX_AUTO_START flag to start automatically.

 + **AppMQTTClientThread** (priority 5, PreemtionThreashold 5) : created with the TX_DONT_START flag to be started later.
 
The **AppMainThread** starts and perform the following actions:

  + starts the DHCP client
  
  + waits for the IP address resolution
  
  + resumes the **AppMQTTClientThread**

The **AppMQTTClientThread**, once started:

  + creates a dns_client with USER_DNS_ADDRESS used as DNS server then get MQTT broker address from MQTT_BROKER_NAME predefined on app_netxduo.h.

  + creates an mqtt_client

  + connects mqtt_client to the online MQTT broker; connection with server will be secure and a **tls_setup_callback** will set TLS parametres. By default MQTT_PORT for encrypted mode is 8883.
  
          refer to note 4 below, to know how to setup an x509 certificate.
  
  + mqtt_client subscribes on a predefined topic TOPIC_NAME  "Temperature" with a Quality Of Service QOS0
  
  + depending on the number of message "NB_MESSAGE" defined by user, mqtt_client will publish a random number generated by RNG. If NB_MESSAGE = 0, it means that number of messages is infinitely.
  
  + mqtt_client will get messages from the MQTT broker and print them. 
  
#### <b> Expected success behavior</b>

 + The board IP address is printed on the HyperTerminal
 + Connection's information are printed on the HyperTerminal (broker's name, mqtt port, topic and messages received)
 
 ```
MQTT client connected to broker < test.mosquitto.org > at PORT 8883 :
Message 1 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 34
Message 2 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 35
Message 3 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 35
Message 4 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 34
Message 5 received: TOPIC = Temperature, MESSAGE = 33
client disconnected from server
 ```
 + Green led is toggling after successfully receiving all messages.
 
#### <b> Error behaviors</b>

+ The red LED is toggling to indicate any error that has occurred.

#### <b> Assumptions if any</b>

- The Application is using the DHCP to acquire IP address, thus a DHCP server should be reachable by the board in the LAN used to test the application.
- The application is configuring the Ethernet IP with a static predefined MAC Address, make sure to change it in case multiple boards are connected on 
the same LAN to avoid any potential network traffic issues.

- The MAC Address is defined in the `main.c`

```
void MX_ETH_Init(void)
{

   /* USER CODE BEGIN ETH_Init 0 */

  /* USER CODE END ETH_Init 0 */

   static uint8_t MACAddr[6];

  /* USER CODE BEGIN ETH_Init 1 */

  /* USER CODE END ETH_Init 1 */
  heth.Instance = ETH;
  heth.Init.AutoNegotiation = ETH_AUTONEGOTIATION_ENABLE;
  heth.Init.Speed = ETH_SPEED_100M;
  heth.Init.DuplexMode = ETH_MODE_FULLDUPLEX;
  heth.Init.PhyAddress = LAN8742A_PHY_ADDRESS;
  MACAddr[0] = 0x00;
  MACAddr[1] = 0x80;
  MACAddr[2] = 0xE1;
  MACAddr[3] = 0x00;
  MACAddr[4] = 0x00;
  MACAddr[5] = 0x00;
```
#### <b>Known limitations</b>

* Default NX_DNS_MAX_RETRIES value in "nx_user.h" may not work with some MQTT servers, they should be tuned for example:

    #define NX_DNS_MAX_RETRIES  10

* Since NetXDuo does not support proxy, mqtt_client should be connected directly to the server.

### <b>Notes</b>
   
 1. To make an encrypted connection with MQTT server, user should follow these steps to add an x509 certificate to the _mqtt\_client_ and use it to ensure server's authentication :
      - download certificate authority CA (in this application "mosquitto.org.der" downloaded from [test.mosquitto](https://test.mosquitto.org)
      - convert certificate downloaded by executing the following cmd from the file downloaded path : 
 
   		                xxd.exe -i mosquitto.org.der > mosquitto.cert.h
				
      - add the converted file under the application : NetXDuo/Nx_MQTT_Client/NetXDuo/App
      - configure MOSQUITTO_CERT_FILE with your certificate name.
 
#### <b>ThreadX usage hints</b>

 - ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs.
 - ThreadX is configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be taken into account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is always possible to reconfigure it in the "tx_user.h", the "TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND" define,but this should be reflected in "tx_initialize_low_level.s" file too.
 - ThreadX is disabling all interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid any unexpected behavior, therefore all system related calls (HAL, BSP) should be done either at the beginning of the application or inside the thread entry functions.
 - ThreadX offers the "tx_application_define()" function, that is automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API.
   It is highly recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools...)  but it should not in any way contain a system API call (HAL or BSP).
 - Using dynamic memory allocation requires to apply some changes to the linker file.
   ThreadX needs to pass a pointer to the first free memory location in RAM to the tx_application_define() function,
   using the "first_unused_memory" argument.
   This require changes in the linker files to expose this memory location.
    + For EWARM add the following section into the .icf file:
     ```
	 place in RAM_region    { last section FREE_MEM };
	 ```
    + For MDK-ARM:
	```
    either define the RW_IRAM1 region in the ".sct" file
    or modify the line below in "tx_low_level_initilize.s to match the memory region being used
        LDR r1, =|Image$$RW_IRAM1$$ZI$$Limit|
	```
    + For STM32CubeIDE add the following section into the .ld file:
	``` 
    ._threadx_heap :
      {
         . = ALIGN(8);
         __RAM_segment_used_end__ = .;
         . = . + 64K;
         . = ALIGN(8);
       } >RAM_D1 AT> RAM_D1
	``` 
	
       The simplest way to provide memory for ThreadX is to define a new section, see ._threadx_heap above.
       In the example above the ThreadX heap size is set to 64KBytes.
       The ._threadx_heap must be located between the .bss and the ._user_heap_stack sections in the linker script.	 
       Caution: Make sure that ThreadX does not need more than the provided heap memory (64KBytes in this example).	 
       Read more in STM32CubeIDE User Guide, chapter: "Linker script".
	  
    + The "tx_initialize_low_level.s" should be also modified to enable the "USE_DYNAMIC_MEMORY_ALLOCATION" flag.
