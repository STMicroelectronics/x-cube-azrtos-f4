<h2><b>Ux_Device_HID_CDC_ACM Application Description</b></h2>
<p>This application provides an example of Azure RTOS USBX stack usage on STM32469I-Discovery board, it shows how to develop a composite USB Device communication Class “HID” and “CDC_ACM” based application. The application is designed to emulate an USB HID mouse device and USB-to-UART bridge following the Virtual COM Port (VCP) implementations, the code provides all required device descriptors framework and associated to both Classes descriptor report to build a composite compliant USB HID_CDC_ACM device. At the beginning ThreadX call the entry function tx_application_define(), at this stage, all USBx resources are initialized, the CDC_ACM and HID Class driver is registered and the application creates 4 threads with the same priorities :</p>
<ul>
<li>usbx_app_thread_entry (Prio : 20; PreemptionPrio : 20) used to initialize USB OTG HAL PCD driver and start the device.</li>
<li>usbx_cdc_acm_read_thread_entry (Prio : 20; PreemptionPrio : 20) used to Read the received data from Virtual COM Port.</li>
<li>usbx_cdc_acm_write_thread_entry (Prio : 20; PreemptionPrio : 20) used to send the received data over UART .</li>
<li>usbx_hid_thread_entry (Prio : 20; PreemptionPrio : 20) used to send HID reports to move automatically the PC host machine cursor.</li>
</ul>
<p>During enumeration phase, four communication pipes “endpoints” are declared in the CDC class and HID implementations :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 x Bulk IN endpoint for receiving data from STM32 device to PC host: When data are received over UART they are saved in the buffer “UserTxBufferFS”. Periodically, in a usbx_cdc_acm_write_thread_entry the state of the buffer “UserTxBufferFS” is checked. If there are available data, they are transmitted in response to IN token otherwise it is NAKed.</p></li>
<li><p>1 x Bulk OUT endpoint for transmitting data from PC host to STM32 device: When data are received through this endpoint they are saved in the buffer “UserRxBufferFS” then they are transmitted over UART using DMA mode and in meanwhile the OUT endpoint is NAKed. Once the transmission is over, the OUT endpoint is prepared to receive next packet in HAL_UART_RxCpltCallback().</p></li>
<li><p>1 x Interrupt IN endpoint for setting and getting serial-port parameters: When control setup is received, the corresponding request is executed in ux_app_parameters_change().</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In CDC_ACM application, two requests are implemented: - Set line: Set the bit rate, number of Stop bits, parity, and number of data bits - Get line: Get the bit rate, number of Stop bits, parity, and number of data bits The other requests (send break, control line state) are not implemented.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 x Interrupt IN endpoint for setting the HID position: When the User Button is pressed the application calls the GetPointerData() API to update the mouse position (x, y) and send the report buffer through the ux_device_class_hid_event_set() API.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note</b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Receiving data over UART is handled by interrupt while transmitting is handled by DMA allowing hence the application to receive data at the same time it is transmitting another data (full- duplex feature). The support of the VCP interface is managed through the ST Virtual COM Port driver available for download from www.st.com.</p></li>
<li><p>The user has to check the list of HID and the COM ports in Device Manager to find out the HID device and the COM port number that have been assigned (by OS) to the VCP interface.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="expected-success-behavior"><b>Expected success behavior</b></h4>
<p>When plugged to PC host, the STM32469I-Discovery must be properly enumerated a composite device as an HID ,USB Serial device and an STlink Com port. During the enumeration phase, device must provides host with the requested descriptors (Device descriptor, configuration descriptor, string descriptors). Those descriptors are used by host driver to identify the device capabilities. Once STM32469I-Discovery USB device successfully completed the enumeration phase. Connect USB cable to Host , Open two hyperterminals (USB com port and UART com port) to send/receive data to/from host to/from device. When USER_Button is pressed, the device sends a HID report. Each report sent should move the PC host machine mouse cursor by one step.</p>
<h4 id="error-behaviors"><b>Error behaviors</b></h4>
<p>Host PC shows that USB device does not operate as designed (Enumeration failed, for example PC Cursor doesn’t move or Com port enumeration failed).</p>

<h3 id="notes"><b>Notes</b></h3>
<h4 id="threadx-usage-hints"><b>ThreadX usage hints</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs.</li>
<li>ThreadX is configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be taken into account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is always possible to reconfigure it in the “tx_user.h”, the “TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND” define,but this should be reflected in “tx_initialize_low_level.s” file too.</li>
<li>ThreadX is disabling all interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid any unexpected behavior, therefore all system related calls (HAL, BSP) should be done either at the beginning of the application or inside the thread entry functions.</li>
<li>ThreadX offers the “tx_application_define()” function, that is automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API. It is highly recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools…) but it should not in any way contain a system API call (HAL or BSP).</li>
<li>Using dynamic memory allocation requires to apply some changes to the linker file. ThreadX needs to pass a pointer to the first free memory location in RAM to the tx_application_define() function, using the “first_unused_memory” argument. This require changes in the linker files to expose this memory location.
<ul>
<li>For EWARM add the following section into the .icf file:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>place in RAM_region    { last section FREE_MEM };</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>For MDK-ARM:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>either define the RW_IRAM1 region in the &quot;.sct&quot; file
or modify the line below in &quot;tx_low_level_initilize.s to match the memory region being used
    LDR r1, =|Image$$RW_IRAM1$$ZI$$Limit|</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>For STM32CubeIDE add the following section into the .ld file:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>._threadx_heap :
  {
     . = ALIGN(8);
     __RAM_segment_used_end__ = .;
     . = . + 64K;
     . = ALIGN(8);
   } &gt;RAM_D1 AT&gt; RAM_D1</code></pre>
<pre><code>The simplest way to provide memory for ThreadX is to define a new section, see ._threadx_heap above.
In the example above the ThreadX heap size is set to 64KBytes.
The ._threadx_heap must be located between the .bss and the ._user_heap_stack sections in the linker script.
Caution: Make sure that ThreadX does not need more than the provided heap memory (64KBytes in this example).
Read more in STM32CubeIDE User Guide, chapter: &quot;Linker script&quot;.</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The “tx_initialize_low_level.s” should be also modified to enable the “USE_DYNAMIC_MEMORY_ALLOCATION” flag.</li>
