<h2><b>Fx_uSD_File_Edit application description</b></h2>
<p>This application provides an example of Azure RTOS FileX stack usage on STM32F469I-Discovery board, it shows how to develop a basic SD card file operations application. The application is designed to handle SD card file operations.</p>
<p>The main entry function, tx_application_define(), is called by ThreadX during kernel start. At this stage, all FileX resources and drivers are initialized.</p>
<p>A single thread is created: - fx_thread (Prio : 10; PreemptionPrio : 10) used to initialize the SD driver and starting FileX’s file operations.</p>
<p>The fx_thread uses FileX services to open the SD media for file operations and attempt to create file STM32.TXT. If the file exists already, it will be overwritten. Dummy content is then written into the file and it is closed. The file is opened once again in read mode and content is checked if matches what was previously written.</p>
<h4 id="expected-success-behavior"><b>Expected success behavior</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>A file named STM32.TXT should be visible in the root directory of the SD card.</li>
<li>A blinking green LED light marks the success of the file operations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="error-behaviors"><b>Error behaviors</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>On failure, the red LED should start blinking.</li>
<li>Error handler is called at the spot where the error occurred.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="assumptions-if-any"><b>Assumptions if any</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>The “SD hot-blug detection” is not supported due to a problem in the HAL/SDMMC driver. As soon as the issue is fixed, the application will be updated.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="known-limitations"><b>Known limitations</b></h4>
<p>None</p>
<h4 id="threadx-usage-hints"><b>ThreadX usage hints</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>ThreadX uses the Systick as time base, thus it is mandatory that the HAL uses a separate time base through the TIM IPs.</li>
<li>ThreadX is configured with 100 ticks/sec by default, this should be taken into account when using delays or timeouts at application. It is always possible to reconfigure it in the “tx_user.h”, the “TX_TIMER_TICKS_PER_SECOND” define,but this should be reflected in “tx_initialize_low_level.s” file too.</li>
<li>ThreadX is disabling all interrupts during kernel start-up to avoid any unexpected behavior, therefore all system related calls (HAL, BSP) should be done either at the beginning of the application or inside the thread entry functions.</li>
<li>ThreadX offers the “tx_application_define()” function, that is automatically called by the tx_kernel_enter() API. It is highly recommended to use it to create all applications ThreadX related resources (threads, semaphores, memory pools…) but it should not in any way contain a system API call (HAL or BSP).</li>
<li>Using dynamic memory allocation requires to apply some changes to the linker file. ThreadX needs to pass a pointer to the first free memory location in RAM to the tx_application_define() function, using the “first_unused_memory” argument. This require changes in the linker files to expose this memory location.
<ul>
<li>For EWARM add the following section into the .icf file:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>place in RAM_region    { last section FREE_MEM };</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>For MDK-ARM:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>either define the RW_IRAM1 region in the &quot;.sct&quot; file
or modify the line below in &quot;tx_low_level_initilize.s to match the memory region being used
    LDR r1, =|Image$$RW_IRAM1$$ZI$$Limit|</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>For STM32CubeIDE add the following section into the .ld file:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>._threadx_heap :
  {
     . = ALIGN(8);
     __RAM_segment_used_end__ = .;
     . = . + 64K;
     . = ALIGN(8);
   } &gt;RAM_D1 AT&gt; RAM_D1</code></pre>
<pre><code>The simplest way to provide memory for ThreadX is to define a new section, see ._threadx_heap above.
In the example above the ThreadX heap size is set to 64KBytes.
The ._threadx_heap must be located between the .bss and the ._user_heap_stack sections in the linker script.  
Caution: Make sure that ThreadX does not need more than the provided heap memory (64KBytes in this example).  
Read more in STM32CubeIDE User Guide, chapter: &quot;Linker script&quot;.</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>The “tx_initialize_low_level.s” should be also modified to enable the “USE_DYNAMIC_MEMORY_ALLOCATION” flag.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="filexlevelx-usage-hints"><b>FileX/LevelX usage hints</b></h4>
<ul>
<li>When calling the fx_media_format() API, it is highly recommended to understand all the parameters used by the API to correctly generate a valid filesystem.</li>
<li>FileX is using data buffers, passed as arguments to fx_media_open(), fx_media_read() and fx_media_write() API it is recommended that these buffers are multiple of sector size and “4 bytes” aligned to avoid unaligned access issues.</li>
