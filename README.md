With Azure RTOS complementing the extensive STM32Cube ecosystem providing free development tools, software bricks, and software expansion packages, STM32 users can also leverage the rich services of Azure RTOS, which meet the needs of tiny, smart, connected devices.

**X-CUBE-AZRTOS-F4** (Azure RTOS Software Expansion for STM32Cube) provides a full integration of **Microsoft Azure RTOS** in the STM32Cube environment for the STM32F4 series of microcontrollers. Ready-to-run applicative examples are also provided for the *NUCLEO-F429ZI* and *STM32469I-DISCO* evaluation boards, thus **reducing the learning curve** and ensuring a **smooth application development experience** with Azure RTOS and STM32F4 MCUs.

The scope of this package covers the following Azure RTOS middleware: RTOS (***ThreadX***), USB Device and Host (***USBX***), File System including NOR/NAND memories support (***FileX*** and ***LevelX***) and Networking including Ethernet and WiFi media (***NetXDuo***).

## Main changes

- First official release of Azure RTOS integration in the STM32Cube Ecosystem for STM32F4 MCU series

## Known limitations

- USBX composite device descriptors
   - A maximum of 2 different class driver can be selected (restriction due to limited EP numbers)
   - A list of USB device Applications supporting auto generation of USB Device framework descriptors provided  for these USB class drivers :MSC, HID mouse, CDC ACM, CDC ECM, DFU. For the other device class drivers, user needs first to 
     disable the device framework builder (refer to : USBx wiki section 2.2 How to customize) and provide the full set of required device descriptors.
- NetXDuo
   - Ethernet cable hot-plug detection not supported.
   - User needs to point to the HAL Drivers under X-CUBE-AZRTOS-F4 install path instead of the default location when creating a NetXDuo based project.
